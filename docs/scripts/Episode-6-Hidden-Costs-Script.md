⚠️ "$0 Premium Plan Cost Me $4,200 in Hidden Fees"

Susan's story. Could be yours.

She thought she saved money with a $0 premium plan. By December, she'd paid $4,200 in costs her agent never mentioned.

Here are the 5 HIDDEN MEDICARE COSTS nobody tells you:

1️⃣ PART B PREMIUM - $2,220/year
→ Standard: $185/month
→ Comes OUT of Social Security  
→ You never see this money
→ High earners ($100K+) pay MORE:
  • $100K income: $259/month ($3,108/year)
  • $200K income: $369/month ($4,428/year)
  • $500K income: $628/month ($7,536/year)

2️⃣ LATE ENROLLMENT PENALTIES - FOREVER
→ Part B: 10% for every 12 months late
→ Part D: Separate penalty
→ NEVER goes away
→ Example: Enroll 2 years late
  • Part B penalty: 20% = $37/month
  • Paid for rest of your life
  • That's $444/year FOREVER

3️⃣ MID-YEAR FORMULARY CHANGES
→ Plans can change drug coverage anytime
→ Real example:
  • January: Lipitor Tier 2 = $30 copay
  • July: Moved to Tier 4 = $150 copay
  • Same drug, 5X more expensive
  • Zero notice, can't change plans until enrollment

4️⃣ OUT-OF-NETWORK SURPRISE BILLS
→ Scenario: You need surgery
→ You choose IN-NETWORK hospital ✓
→ But anesthesiologist is OUT-OF-NETWORK ✗
→ You get $3,500 surprise bill
→ You never chose them, never knew
→ Common with: Anesthesia, radiology, pathology

5️⃣ WHAT MEDICARE DOESN'T COVER AT ALL
→ Hearing aids: $3,000-$6,000
→ Dentures: $1,500-$5,000
→ Glasses: $300-$800
→ Routine dental: $500-$2,000/year
→ Medicare coverage: $0
→ Some Advantage plans cover some of this
→ Original Medicare: nothing

BONUS HIDDEN COST:
Your plan premium can INCREASE every year
→ $50/month plan this year
→ $85/month plan next year
→ Same coverage, 70% higher cost

THE MATH:
"$0 Premium" Medicare Advantage Plan:
• Plan premium: $0
• Part B premium: $2,220/year
• Copays/coinsurance: $1,500/year  
• Formulary increases: $400/year
• Equipment needs: $500/year
──────────────────────
REAL TOTAL: $4,620/year

### **Common Follow-Up Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "Why don't agents tell you about Part B premium?"**
A: "Because they don't get paid on Part B (it's government, not insurance). They focus on what they sell - the Advantage or Supplement plans. But YOU need to know your total cost! That's why we show everything."

**Q: "Can I avoid the Part B premium?"**
A: "No, everyone on Medicare pays it (unless you qualify for financial assistance). But high earners can sometimes reduce it by managing their income in the years before 65. Talk to a financial advisor about IRMAA planning."

**Q: "How do I check if a doctor is in-network?"**
A: "Call the doctor's office AND the insurance plan. Get it in writing if possible. For surgery, ask the hospital about ALL providers (surgeon, anesthesiologist, pathologist, radiologist). This prevents surprise bills!"

**Q: "Do any plans cover hearing aids?"**
A: "Some Medicare Advantage plans include hearing aid benefits ($500-$2,000 allowance typically). Original Medicare does NOT. This is one advantage of MA plans. Want me to show you which plans offer the best hearing coverage?"

**Q: "What if I can't afford all these hidden costs?"**
A: "This is exactly why planning matters! Let's calculate YOUR expected costs and find the most affordable TOTAL package for you. Sometimes paying a higher premium actually costs less overall. Book a review at YourMedGuy.com"

**Q: "Is the Part B premium the same in every state?"**
A: "YES! Part B premium is federal - same nationwide. But Advantage/Supplement plan premiums vary by location. That's why local expertise matters."
