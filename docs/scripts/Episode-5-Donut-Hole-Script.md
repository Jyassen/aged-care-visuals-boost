## **VERSION 1: 60-SECOND SCRIPT**

### **[0-7 seconds] - HOOK**
**VISUAL:** Donut with bite taken out + prescription bottles + confused expression  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "Why Is It Called the Medicare Donut Hole?"  
**VOICEOVER:**  
*"The Medicare Donut Hole. Weird name, expensive problem. If you take prescriptions, this will hit your wallet. Here's what it actually means..."*

- "Phase 2: Normal Coverage"
- "Phase 3: DONUT HOLE 🍩"
- "Phase 4: Catastrophic"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"It's officially called the coverage gap. Your Part D drug plan has four phases. First, you pay your deductible - around $500. Then you have normal coverage with copays. But once your total drug costs hit about $5,000, you enter the Donut Hole - Phase 3. Here, you pay 25% of drug costs. That's MORE than your normal copays. Finally, after $8,000 in spending, you hit catastrophic coverage and pay almost nothing."*

### **[29-48 seconds] - REAL EXAMPLE**
**VISUAL:** Calendar showing months + prescription bottle + rising costs  
**TEXT OVERLAY:**

- "December: Hit $8,000, back to $5/month"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Here's how it hits real people: Maria pays $30 a month for her prescriptions. In June, her total drug costs hit $5,000 and she enters the Donut Hole. Now she pays 25% - about $200 a month. This lasts until December when she finally hits $8,000 and drops back down to almost nothing."*

**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Will YOU hit the Donut Hole?"

**TEXT OVERLAY:** "Last Month: $30. This Month: $287. Same Prescription."  
**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Tom walked into his pharmacy in June. Same prescription he's been taking all year. Last month: $30. This month: $287. What changed? He hit the Medicare Donut Hole. Here's what that means and how to avoid it..."*

### **[9-35 seconds] - THE 4 PHASES EXPLAINED**
**VISUAL:** Animated journey through donut graphic with clear markers  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 

**"PHASE 1: DEDUCTIBLE PHASE"**
- You pay: First $500-$600
- "Until you hit your deductible"

**"PHASE 2: INITIAL COVERAGE"**
- You pay: Copays ($10-$47 typical)
- "Life is good here"
- "Until total costs = $5,030"

**"PHASE 3: DONUT HOLE (Coverage Gap)"**
- You pay: 25% of drug costs
- "This is where it hurts"
- "From $5,030 to $8,000 total"

**"PHASE 4: CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE"**
- You pay: Almost nothing ($4-$10)
- "After $8,000 you're protected"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Medicare Part D has four phases. Phase One: You pay your deductible, usually $500 to $600. Phase Two: Initial coverage - you pay your normal copays, maybe $10 to $47 per prescription. Life is good. But once your TOTAL drug costs hit $5,030, you enter Phase Three: the Donut Hole. Now you pay 25% of the drug cost instead of a small copay. This is significantly more. You stay here until you've spent about $8,000 total, then you hit Phase Four: catastrophic coverage, where you pay almost nothing. The Donut Hole is the expensive middle."*

### **[36-62 seconds] - REAL SCENARIOS**
**VISUAL:** Three different people with their medications and costs  

**TEXT OVERLAY:**

**"SCENARIO 1: LOW-COST DRUGS"**
- Generic medications: $100/month
- Annual cost: $1,200
- "Never hits Donut Hole ✓"

**"SCENARIO 2: MODERATE DRUGS"**
- Name brand + generics: $400/month  
- Hits Donut Hole in: October
- "2 months in the hole"
- Extra cost: $400

**"SCENARIO 3: EXPENSIVE DRUGS"**
- Multiple name brands: $1,200/month
- Hits Donut Hole in: MAY
- "6 months in the hole"  
- Extra cost: $2,400+
- "Then hits catastrophic = savings!"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Let's look at real scenarios. If you take generic medications costing $100 a month, you'll never hit the Donut Hole. You're safe. If you take name-brand drugs costing $400 monthly, you'll hit the Donut Hole in October and spend two expensive months there - costing about $400 extra. But if you take expensive medications - $1,200 a month - you'll hit the Donut Hole in May and stay there through October. That's six months of paying 25% - potentially $2,400 extra. However, you'll then hit catastrophic coverage and pay almost nothing for November and December, saving money at the end."*

### **[63-82 seconds] - SOLUTIONS**
**VISUAL:** Three solution cards appearing  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 

**"SOLUTION 1: Choose plans without a gap"**
- "Some Part D plans cover the Donut Hole"
- "Higher premium, but worth it?"

**"SOLUTION 2: Switch to generics"**
- "Talk to your doctor"
- "Can reduce costs dramatically"

**"SOLUTION 3: Use manufacturer assistance"**
- "Many drugs have help programs"
- "Can get you through the gap"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"So how do you avoid this? Solution one: choose a Part D plan that covers the Donut Hole. They exist, but have higher premiums - run the math. Solution two: ask your doctor about generic alternatives. This can keep you out of the gap entirely. Solution three: check manufacturer assistance programs. Many drug companies help patients through the Donut Hole."*

🍩 The Medicare Donut Hole: What It Is and Why It Costs You More

Weird name. Real expensive problem. Here's what it actually means:

DONUT HOLE = Medicare Part D Coverage Gap

THE 4 PHASES:

📍 PHASE 1: Deductible
→ You pay first $500-$600
→ Then move to Phase 2

📍 PHASE 2: Initial Coverage  
→ Normal copays ($10-$47)
→ Life is good here
→ Until total drug costs hit $5,030

📍 PHASE 3: DONUT HOLE 🍩
→ You pay 25% of drug costs
→ This is MORE than your copay
→ From $5,030 to $8,000 total spending

📍 PHASE 4: Catastrophic Coverage
→ You pay almost nothing ($4-$10)
→ After $8,000 in total drug costs

REAL EXAMPLE:
Maria's prescription costs:
• Jan-May: $30/month (normal copay)
• June: Hits $5,030 total → ENTERS DONUT HOLE
• Jun-Nov: $200/month (25% of cost)
• December: Hits $8,000 → Catastrophic coverage
• Dec: Back to $5/month

Same prescription. VERY different costs depending on the phase.

WHO HITS THE DONUT HOLE?

🍩 "Last Month: $30. This Month: $287. Same Prescription."

Tom's pharmacy shock. You could be next. Here's how the Medicare Donut Hole works:

THE DONUT HOLE (Coverage Gap) hits when total drug costs reach $5,030.

Suddenly you pay 25% of drug costs instead of small copays.

THE 4 PHASES EXPLAINED:

1️⃣ DEDUCTIBLE PHASE ($0-$500)
→ You pay everything until you hit deductible

2️⃣ INITIAL COVERAGE ($500-$5,030)
→ You pay copays: $10-$47 per prescription
→ This is the comfortable zone

3️⃣ DONUT HOLE ($5,030-$8,000) 🍩
→ You pay 25% of each drug's cost
→ Significantly more than copays
→ The expensive middle zone

4️⃣ CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE ($8,000+)
→ You pay almost nothing ($4-$10)
→ Insurance covers nearly everything

WHO HITS THE DONUT HOLE?

🟢 Generic drugs only ($100/month) → Never hits hole ✓

🟡 Name brand + generics ($400/month) → Hits hole in October
• Extra cost: ~$400 over 2 months

🔴 Multiple expensive drugs ($1,200/month) → Hits hole in MAY
• Extra cost: ~$2,400 over 6 months
• But then hits catastrophic and saves money Nov-Dec

3 WAYS TO AVOID/MINIMIZE IT:

✅ Choose Part D plan with gap coverage
• Higher premium but fills the donut hole
• Worth it if you have expensive meds

✅ Switch to generic medications
• Ask your doctor about alternatives
• Can prevent hitting the gap entirely

✅ Use manufacturer assistance programs
• Many drug companies offer help
• Can bridge the gap period

THE BOTTOM LINE:
Know YOUR drugs. Calculate if YOU'LL hit the Donut Hole. Choose the right plan BEFORE enrolling.

### **Common Follow-Up Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "Does the Donut Hole reset every year?"**
A: "YES! Every January 1st you start over at Phase 1 (deductible). If you hit catastrophic coverage in November, you'll drop back to deductible phase on Jan 1. This is important for budgeting!"

**Q: "Do all Part D plans have a Donut Hole?"**
A: "Most do, but some plans offer 'gap coverage' - they cover your costs IN the Donut Hole. These plans have higher premiums but can save money if you have expensive drugs. Want me to show you which plans have gap coverage?"

**Q: "What if I hit the Donut Hole in December?"**
A: "Then it resets in January anyway! You won't hit catastrophic coverage. This is why TIMING matters. If you'll hit it late in the year, it might not be worth paying for gap coverage."

**Q: "Do vaccines count toward the Donut Hole?"**
A: "Great question! Part B vaccines (flu, pneumonia, shingles) DON'T count - they're covered differently. But Part D medications DO count toward pushing you through the phases."

**Q: "What's considered 'catastrophic coverage'?"**
A: "After you've spent about $8,000 total on drugs in a year, you pay either $4.50 for generics or $11.20 for brand names, OR 5% of the cost - whichever is greater. Basically almost nothing!"

**Q: "Can I change plans if I realize I'll hit the Donut Hole?"**
A: "Only during Annual Enrollment Period (Oct 15-Dec 7) for next year, or if you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period. This is why calculating BEFORE enrolling is so important!"
