### **[0-8 seconds] - HOOK**
**VISUAL:** Person looking at three different plans, confused, calculator in hand  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "Stop Guessing. Here's How to Calculate YOUR Real Medicare Costs."  
**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Most people choose a Medicare plan by guessing. Then they're shocked by the bills. Stop guessing. Here's exactly how to calculate what YOU will actually pay. Five simple steps..."*

---

### **[9-22 seconds] - STEP 1: LIST YOUR DOCTORS**
**VISUAL:** Checklist appearing + doctor icons  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "STEP 1: List YOUR Doctors"
- "✓ Primary care doctor"
- "✓ Specialists (cardiologist, etc.)"
- "✓ Therapists"
- "How many visits per year?"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Step One: List YOUR doctors. Primary care, specialists, therapists - everyone you see. How many times per year? This matters. If you see your primary care doctor monthly, that's 12 visits. Write it down."*

---

### **[23-37 seconds] - STEP 2: LIST YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS**
**VISUAL:** Prescription bottles appearing + calculator  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "STEP 2: List YOUR Prescriptions"

- "• Metformin 500mg - twice daily"
- "• Lisinopril 10mg - once daily"
- "• Atorvastatin 20mg - once daily"
- "Check each plan's formulary"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Step Two: List every prescription. Exact names, exact dosages. Don't guess. Look at your bottles. For each drug, check the plan's formulary to see what tier it's on and what you'll pay. This is where most people find huge cost differences between plans."*

---

### **[38-52 seconds] - STEP 3: ADD EXPECTED PROCEDURES**
**VISUAL:** Calendar with medical procedures marked + cost estimates  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "STEP 3: Expected Procedures"

- "• Regular MRIs: Check coinsurance"
- "Add deductible + copays/coinsurance"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Step Three: What procedures are you planning? Hip replacement? Regular MRIs? Cancer screenings? Add up the deductible plus any copays or coinsurance for these. Some preventive care is free, but most procedures have costs. Know them upfront."*

---

### **[53-70 seconds] - STEP 4: DON'T FORGET PREMIUMS**
**VISUAL:** Premium amounts stacking up  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "STEP 4: Include ALL Premiums"

- "Part D premium: $35/month × 12 = $420"
- "──────────────────"
- "Total premiums: $3,240/year"
- "(Before you even use healthcare!)"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Step Four: Add all premiums. Your plan premium times twelve. Part B premium - $185 a month - times twelve. Part D if separate. These are costs you pay every month whether you use healthcare or not. In this example, that's $3,240 per year before you see a single doctor."*

**VISUAL:** Calculator showing final total + comparison chart  
**TEXT OVERLAY:**

- ""
- "Now compare to OTHER plans!"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Step Five: Add it all up. Premiums, doctor visits, prescriptions, procedures. This is YOUR real annual Medicare cost. Now do this same calculation for two or three different plans. The plan with the lowest premium often has the highest total cost. Compare real numbers, not marketing."*

📊 How to Calculate YOUR Real Medicare Costs (5 Simple Steps)

Stop guessing. Start knowing. Here's exactly how to calculate what YOU'LL actually pay:

STEP 1️⃣: LIST YOUR DOCTORS
→ Primary care physician
→ Specialists (cardiologist, endocrinologist, etc.)
→ Therapists, chiropractors
→ HOW MANY visits per year?

Example: 12 PCP visits × $20 copay = $240/year

STEP 2️⃣: LIST YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS
→ Write down EXACT names and dosages
→ Look at your bottles
→ Check EACH plan's formulary (drug list)
→ See what tier your drug is on
→ Calculate copay × 12 months

Example: 
• Metformin (Tier 1): $10/month = $120/year
• Lipitor (Tier 3): $47/month = $564/year
• Eliquis (Tier 4): $95/month = $1,140/year
Total prescriptions: $1,824/year

STEP 3️⃣: EXPECTED PROCEDURES
→ Planning surgery?
→ Regular screenings?
→ Ongoing treatments?
→ Add deductible + copays/coinsurance

Example:
• Annual colonoscopy: $0 (preventive)
• Knee replacement: $1,676 deductible + $2,000 coinsurance
• Quarterly blood work: $60 each = $240/year

STEP 4️⃣: INCLUDE ALL PREMIUMS
→ Plan premium × 12 months
→ Part B premium × 12 months ($185/month standard)
→ Part D premium × 12 months (if separate)

Example:
• Plan premium: $50/month = $600/year
• Part B premium: $185/month = $2,220/year
• Part D premium: Included in plan
Total premiums: $2,820/year

(You pay this even if you never use healthcare!)

STEP 5️⃣: ADD IT ALL UP
→ Premiums: $2,820
→ Doctor visits: $480
→ Prescriptions: $1,824
→ Procedures: $2,240
──────────────────
YOUR REAL COST: $7,364/year

NOW REPEAT FOR 2-3 OTHER PLANS
Compare TOTAL costs, not just premiums!

REAL EXAMPLE:
Maria compared two plans:
• Plan A: $0 premium → $6,800 total cost
• Plan B: $100/month premium → $5,200 total cost

She saved $1,600/year by paying a higher premium!

THE TRUTH:
• Lowest premium ≠ Lowest total cost
• Your health needs determine best plan
• Generic drugs vs brand names = huge difference
• One surgery can change everything

WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO WRONG:
❌ Choose based only on premium
❌ Forget Part B premium
❌ Don't check their specific drugs
❌ Assume "more visits = higher costs"

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:
✓ Calculate for YOUR specific situation
✓ Compare 3-4 different plans
✓ Factor in planned procedures
✓ Review annually (costs change!)

### **Common Follow-Up Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "What if I don't know how many doctor visits I'll need?"**
A: "Look at last year! How many times did you see doctors in 2023? That's your baseline. Add extra if you have upcoming procedures. It's not perfect but it's way better than guessing!"

**Q: "Where do I find a plan's formulary?"**
A: "Medicare.gov has every plan's formulary! Go to 'Find health & drug plans' → Enter your ZIP → Select plans to compare → Click 'View formulary.' Or comment your plan name and I'll look it up for you!"

**Q: "Should I include dental and vision in this?"**
A: "Good question! Original Medicare doesn't cover routine dental/vision, so budget separately for those ($500-2,000/year typically). Some Advantage plans include it - factor that in if comparing!"

**Q: "What if I have a really expensive year with surgery?"**
A: "This is where the out-of-pocket maximum from Episode 4 matters! With Medicare Advantage, you cap at ~$8,000. With Original Medicare + Medigap, you're protected differently. Let's calculate both scenarios for you."

**Q: "Do I need to recalculate every year?"**
A: "YES! Plans change premiums, formularies, and networks every year. What was best this year might not be best next year. Review annually during Open Enrollment (Oct 15-Dec 7)."

**Q: "Can you just tell me which plan to choose?"**
A: "I wish it was that simple! The 'best' plan depends on YOUR specific doctors, drugs, and health. But I can calculate your costs for each option and show you the winner. That's what our free consultation does - book at YourMedGuy.com!"
