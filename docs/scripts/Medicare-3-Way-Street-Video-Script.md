### **[9-28 seconds] - PATH 1: ORIGINAL MEDICARE**
**VISUAL:** Highway with some gaps/bridges out + Medicare card animation  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Path #1: Original Medicare"

*"Path one: Original Medicare - Parts A and B. This is the government program. It covers about 80% of costs. You pay the other 20%, with no cap.

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Path two: Medicare Advantage. This is private insurance that replaces Original Medicare. These plans bundle everything - medical, hospital, usually drugs, sometimes dental and vision. Lower monthly costs appeal to many people. But here's the catch: you're locked into their network of doctors. Need a referral to see specialists. If you travel or have doctors you love, this can be limiting."*

*"Path three: Medigap, also called Medicare Supplement. This works WITH Original Medicare to fill in those gaps. You pay a higher monthly premium, but your out-of-pocket costs become very predictable. You can see any doctor who accepts Medicare, anywhere in the country. No networks. No referrals. No surprise bills. You're paying for freedom and peace of mind."*
