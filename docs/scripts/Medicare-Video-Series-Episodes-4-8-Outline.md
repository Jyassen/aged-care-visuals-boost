## **EPISODE 4: "Out-of-Pocket Maximum Explained"**

### **Core Concept:**
Explain what an out-of-pocket maximum is, why it matters, and the HUGE difference between plans that have one vs. don't.

### **60-Second Script Outline:**

**Hook (0-7s):**  
*"The most important Medicare number nobody tells you about..."*

**Main Content (8-50s):**
- **What is it:** The MOST you'll pay in a year, then insurance covers 100%
- **Who has it:** Medicare Advantage plans ($8,000-$10,000 typical)
- **Who DOESN'T:** Original Medicare (NO CAP on that 20%!)
- **Real example:** $100,000 cancer treatment
  - Medicare Advantage: You pay $8,000 max
  - Original Medicare: You pay $20,000+ (no limit!)
- **Why it matters:** Protects you from catastrophic costs

**CTA (51-60s):**  
*"This one number can save you tens of thousands. Comment GUIDE for plan comparison or book at YourMedGuy.com"*

### **Key Visual:**
- Meter filling up to maximum, then stops (Advantage)
- Meter filling up with no limit, breaking through ceiling (Original Medicare)
- Side-by-side cost comparison for expensive procedure

### **Why This Episode:**
- Most people don't know Original Medicare has NO out-of-pocket maximum
- This is the #1 reason people get Medigap or choose Advantage
- Creates urgency around plan selection
- High shareability ("Did you know...?")

## **EPISODE 5: "The Donut Hole Demystified"**

### **Core Concept:**
Break down the confusing Medicare Part D "coverage gap" (donut hole) in simple terms with real examples.

### **60-Second Script Outline:**

**Hook (0-7s):**  
*"Why is it called the Medicare Donut Hole? And why does it cost you more money?"*

**Main Content (8-50s):**
- **Visual:** Donut graphic with hole in middle
- **Phase 1 - Deductible:** You pay first ~$500
- **Phase 2 - Initial Coverage:** You pay copay/coinsurance (good!)
- **Phase 3 - DONUT HOLE:** Once you hit ~$5,000 total drug costs
  - You pay 25% of brand name drugs
  - You pay 25% of generic drugs
  - This is MORE than before!
- **Phase 4 - Catastrophic:** After $8,000 you pay almost nothing
- **Real example:** Someone on expensive meds hitting donut hole in June, paying $200/month more until December

**CTA (51-60s):**  
*"If you take expensive medications, this matters. Comment GUIDE for drug cost calculator or book at YourMedGuy.com"*

### **Key Visual:**
- Animated donut with 4 phases clearly marked
- Dollar amounts at each phase
- Timeline showing when typical person hits each phase
- Comparison: Plan with donut hole vs. plan without

### **Why This Episode:**
- Donut hole confuses everyone
- Critical for people on multiple/expensive medications
- Shows expertise (most agents don't explain this well)
- Leads naturally to Part D plan comparison tool

## **EPISODE 6: "Hidden Costs Nobody Tells You"**

### **Core Concept:**
Reveal the costs that don't show up in plan comparisons but impact your wallet.

### **60-Second Script Outline:**

**Hook (0-7s):**  
*"Your Medicare agent showed you the premium. But they didn't mention these 5 hidden costs..."*

**Main Content (8-50s):**
**Hidden Cost #1:** Part B Premium ($185/month) - comes out of Social Security
**Hidden Cost #2:** Late enrollment penalties (can last LIFETIME)
**Hidden Cost #3:** Formulary changes mid-year (your drug suddenly costs more)
**Hidden Cost #4:** Out-of-network "gotcha" bills (even in-network hospitals have out-of-network docs)
**Hidden Cost #5:** Medical equipment not covered (walkers, hearing aids, etc.)

**Bonus mention:** Plan premiums can increase each year

**CTA (51-60s):**  
*"Know ALL your costs upfront. Comment GUIDE for complete cost breakdown or YourMedGuy.com"*

### **Key Visual:**
- Iceberg graphic (premium above water, hidden costs below)
- Each cost appearing with dollar amount
- Calculator showing "Actual Total Cost"
- Side-by-side: "What they show you" vs "What you actually pay"

### **Why This Episode:**

- High engagement (people share "I didn't know this!")

## **EPISODE 7: "How to Calculate YOUR Real Costs"**

### **Core Concept:**
Step-by-step walkthrough of how to actually calculate what YOU will pay, not hypothetical scenarios.

### **90-Second Script Outline (needs longer format):**

**Hook (0-8s):**  
*"Stop guessing. Here's exactly how to calculate YOUR Medicare costs in 5 steps..."*

**Main Content (9-80s):**

**Step 1:** List YOUR doctors (primary, specialists, therapists)
- Check if they accept plan you're considering
- Factor in: 12 PCP visits = 12 × $20 copay = $240

**Step 2:** List YOUR prescriptions (exact names and dosages)
- Look up on plan's formulary
- Check tier level
- Calculate: 12 months × copay per drug

**Step 3:** Add YOUR expected procedures
- Planned surgery?
- Regular tests (MRI, bloodwork)?
- Calculate deductible + coinsurance/copay

**Step 4:** Don't forget the premium
- Monthly premium × 12 months
- Part B premium (comes out of Social Security)
- Part D premium

**Step 5:** Add it all up
- Total annual cost = Premium + Deductible + Copays/Coinsurance

**Example Walkthrough:**
Show real calculation with actual numbers for hypothetical person

**CTA (81-90s):**  
*"Or skip the math - use our free calculator. Comment GUIDE or YourMedGuy.com"*

### **Key Visual:**
- Checklist appearing on screen
- Calculator overlaying each step
- Spreadsheet graphic showing formula
- Before/After: "Guessing vs Knowing"
- Screen recording of cost calculator tool in action

### **Why This Episode:**

- Can be repurposed as blog post, PDF guide

## **EPISODE 8: "Premium vs Total Cost: What Really Matters"**

### **Core Concept:**
Explain why choosing based on lowest premium is often the most expensive mistake.

### **60-Second Script Outline:**

**Hook (0-7s):**  
*"A $0 premium plan cost Sarah $8,000 more than a $200/month plan. Here's how..."*

**Main Content (8-50s):**

**The Trap:** Everyone shops for lowest premium
- $0 premium plan looks amazing!
- But premium is just ONE cost

**Real Example - Plan A vs Plan B:**

**Plan A: $0 Premium**
- Deductible: $500
- PCP Copay: $40
- Specialist: $80
- Hospital: $500/day
- **Sarah's annual cost:** $8,740

**Plan B: $200/month Premium**
- Deductible: $0
- PCP Copay: $10
- Specialist: $30
- Hospital: $250/day
- **Sarah's annual cost:** $5,400

**The Math:** Plan A looks free but costs $3,340 MORE per year!

**CTA (51-60s):**  
*"Total cost is what matters. Calculate yours: Comment GUIDE or YourMedGuy.com"*

### **Key Visual:**
- Two plan cards side-by-side
- Premium highlighted on each
- Then reveal total costs below
- Bar graph showing premium vs total cost
- "Don't fall for the $0 trap" warning

### **Extended 90-Second Version Additions:**
- Show 3-4 different health scenarios:
  - Healthy person who rarely goes to doctor
  - Person with chronic condition
  - Someone planning surgery
  - Frequent prescription user
- Best plan changes based on YOUR situation
- When $0 premium DOES make sense vs when it doesn't

### **Why This Episode:**
- Addresses #1 consumer mistake
- Creates "aha moment" 
- Differentiates from agents who just show premiums
- Natural lead to consultation ("Let me help you calculate")
- Can be controversial/engaging in comments
