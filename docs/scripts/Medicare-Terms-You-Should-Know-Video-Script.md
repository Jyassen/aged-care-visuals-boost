## **VERSION 1: 60-SECOND SCRIPT**

### **[0-7 seconds] - HOOK**
**VISUAL:** Confused person looking at medical bills with question marks floating  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "3 Medicare Terms You Must Know"  
**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Medicare has confusing terms. But you only need to understand three to know what you'll actually pay. Here they are..."*

---

### **[8-25 seconds] - TERM 1: DEDUCTIBLE**
**VISUAL:** Piggy bank filling up + calendar showing beginning of year  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Term #1: DEDUCTIBLE"
- "What you pay BEFORE insurance kicks in"
- "Medical: $1,676 (2026)"
- "Drug: Varies by plan"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"First: Deductible. This is what you pay out of pocket before your insurance starts helping. Original Medicare has a $1,676 deductible for hospital stays. Drug plans have their own deductibles - usually $200 to $500. You pay this fresh every January."*

---

### **[26-43 seconds] - TERM 2: COPAY**
**VISUAL:** Doctor visit + prescription pickup + cash register  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Term #2: COPAY"
- "Fixed amount per visit/prescription"
- "Example: $20 doctor visit"
- "Example: $10 prescription"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Second: Copay. This is a fixed amount you pay each time you use a service. Twenty dollars for a doctor visit. Ten dollars for a prescription. Simple and predictable. You know exactly what you'll pay."*

---

### **[44-54 seconds] - TERM 3: COINSURANCE**
**VISUAL:** Pie chart showing 80/20 split + medical bill calculation animation  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Term #3: COINSURANCE"
- "You pay a PERCENTAGE"
- "Example: 20% of $5,000 = $1,000 you pay"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Third: Coinsurance. This is a percentage you pay. Original Medicare covers 80%, you pay 20%. If your surgery costs $5,000, you pay $1,000. This can add up without a cap."*

---

### **[55-60 seconds] - CTA**
**VISUAL:** YourMedGuy logo + phone number  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Know your real costs BEFORE enrolling"
- "Comment: GUIDE"
- "Book: YourMedGuy.com"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Understanding these three terms helps you compare plans. Comment GUIDE for our cost breakdown tool, or book at YourMedGuy.com."*

---

## **VERSION 2: 90-SECOND EXTENDED SCRIPT**

### **[0-8 seconds] - HOOK**
**VISUAL:** Medical bills piling up + confused expressions  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "Stop! Before You Enroll, Know These 3 Terms"  
**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Most people enroll in Medicare without understanding these three terms. Then they get surprised by bills. Don't be that person. Here's what you need to know..."*

---

### **[9-32 seconds] - TERM 1: DEDUCTIBLE**
**VISUAL:** Calendar showing January 1st + hospital building + wallet opening  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Term #1: DEDUCTIBLE"
- "Amount YOU pay BEFORE insurance helps"
- "Medicare Part A: $1,676 per hospital stay"
- "Medicare Part B: $257 per year"
- "Drug Plans: $200-$500 typically"
- "Resets every January 1st"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Term one: Deductible. This is what you must pay out of pocket before your insurance starts covering anything. Original Medicare Part A - that's hospital coverage - has a $1,676 deductible per benefit period. Part B has a $257 annual deductible. Drug plans have their own deductibles, usually $200 to $500. And here's the kicker: it resets every January 1st. Every year, you start over."*

---

### **[33-57 seconds] - TERM 2: COPAY**
**VISUAL:** Doctor's office + prescription counter + specific dollar amounts appearing  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Term #2: COPAY"
- "FIXED dollar amount per service"
- "Primary Care: $0-$25"
- "Specialist: $30-$50"
- "Generic Drug: $5-$10"
- "Brand Drug: $40-$100"
- "Same amount every time"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Term two: Copay, short for co-payment. This is a fixed dollar amount you pay each time you use a service. See your primary care doctor? Maybe $20. Specialist? Could be $40. Pick up a generic prescription? Ten bucks. The key word is FIXED. You know exactly what you'll pay every time. Makes budgeting easier. Medicare Advantage plans typically use copays more than Original Medicare."*

---

### **[58-80 seconds] - TERM 3: COINSURANCE**
**VISUAL:** Calculator + 80/20 split animation + real medical bill example  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Term #3: COINSURANCE"
- "You pay a PERCENTAGE of the cost"
- "Original Medicare: 80/20 split"
- "Example 1: $1,000 test = $200 you pay"
- "Example 2: $10,000 surgery = $2,000 you pay"
- "No limit on Original Medicare!"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Term three: Coinsurance. This is a percentage you're responsible for. Original Medicare typically covers 80%, you pay 20%. Sounds simple, but watch out: if your MRI costs $1,000, you pay $200. If your hip surgery costs $10,000, you pay $2,000. And with Original Medicare, there's no out-of-pocket maximum. That 20% can add up fast. This is why many people add a Medigap plan - to cover that coinsurance."*

---

### **[81-90 seconds] - COMPARISON & CTA**
**VISUAL:** All three terms side by side + YourMedGuy logo  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "DEDUCTIBLE: Pay first (resets yearly)"
- "COPAY: Fixed $ per visit"
- "COINSURANCE: % of total cost"
- "Know YOUR costs: YourMedGuy.com"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"So remember: Deductible is what you pay first. Copay is a fixed amount. Coinsurance is a percentage. Different plans use these differently. Comment GUIDE for our cost calculator, or book a consultation at YourMedGuy.com to see your actual costs."*

💰 Medicare Costs Explained: Deductible vs Copay vs Coinsurance

Most people enroll in Medicare without understanding these terms. Then the bills arrive. 😰

Here's your crash course in Medicare costs:

🏥 DEDUCTIBLE - Pay THIS FIRST before insurance helps
• Part A (Hospital): $1,676 per stay
• Part B (Medical): $257 per year  
• Part D (Drugs): $200-$500 typically
• Resets EVERY January 1st

👨‍⚕️ COPAY - FIXED dollar amount per service
• Primary care: $0-$25
• Specialist: $30-$50
• Generic Rx: $5-$10
• Brand Rx: $40-$100
• Same amount every single time = easy to budget

📊 COINSURANCE - You pay a PERCENTAGE
• Original Medicare: 80/20 split
• You pay 20% of EVERY service
• $1,000 test? You pay $200
• $10,000 surgery? You pay $2,000
• NO out-of-pocket maximum on Original Medicare!

REAL EXAMPLE:
Hospital stay: $20,000
→ Original Medicare: You pay $5,341
→ Medicare Advantage: You pay $2,450 (capped)
→ Medigap Plan G: You pay $257

Same hospital stay. VERY different out-of-pocket costs.

This is why you need to know YOUR costs before enrolling.

## **ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:**

### **Pinned Comment:**
"💡 Drop your actual scenario below and I'll tell you if it's a deductible, copay, or coinsurance situation. Real examples help everyone learn!"

### **Auto-Reply for "GUIDE":**
"Just sent you our Medicare Cost Calculator! It breaks down YOUR specific deductible, copays, and coinsurance. Check your DMs 📩"

### **Common Follow-Up Questions:**

**Q: "What's an out-of-pocket maximum?"**  
A: "Great question! That's the MOST you'll pay in a year. Medicare Advantage plans have them ($8,000-$10,000 typically). Original Medicare does NOT. This is huge. Want me to make a video about this?"

**Q: "Which is better: copay or coinsurance?"**  
A: "Depends on your situation! Copays are predictable. Coinsurance can be cheaper IF you don't use much healthcare, but riskier for expensive procedures. Let's calculate YOUR scenario."

**Q: "How do I know what my plan uses?"**  
A: "Check your 'Summary of Benefits' document. Or comment your plan name and I'll tell you. Or book a free review at YourMedGuy.com"

**Q: "Do all Medicare Advantage plans use copays?"**  
A: "Most do, but not all! Some use coinsurance. Some use BOTH depending on the service. This is why comparing plans is so important."

**Q: "Can I get a plan with NO deductible?"**  
A: "Yes! Many Medicare Advantage plans have $0 deductible. But watch the copays and coinsurance - sometimes they're higher to make up for it. Total cost matters."
