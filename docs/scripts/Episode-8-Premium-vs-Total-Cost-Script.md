- **Series:** Medicare Made Simple - Episode 8 of 8 (FINALE)
- **CTA:** Comment "GUIDE" or book appointment

---

## **VERSION 1: 60-SECOND SCRIPT**

### **[0-7 seconds] - HOOK**
**VISUAL:** Two people, one happy paying $0, one shocked paying $8,000  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "She Paid $0/Month. He Paid $200/Month. Guess Who Saved Money?"  
**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Linda chose the $0 premium plan. Bob paid $200 a month. At the end of the year, Bob saved $2,400. Here's how premium and total cost are completely different..."*

---

### **[8-28 seconds] - THE TRAP**
**VISUAL:** $0 premium plan highlighted + hidden costs appearing beneath  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "THE $0 PREMIUM TRAP"
- "Monthly Premium: $0"
- "BUT..."
- "PCP Copay: $40 (was $10)"
- "Specialist: $80 (was $40)"
- "Drugs: Higher tiers"
- "Hospital: $500/day"
- "They get you somewhere else"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"The trap: $0 premium plans look free. But they make money back through higher copays, higher coinsurance, worse drug formularies, and bigger deductibles. $0 premium doesn't mean $0 cost. It means they get you somewhere else."*

---

### **[29-48 seconds] - REAL COMPARISON**
**VISUAL:** Side-by-side annual cost breakdown  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
```
LINDA ($0 premium)       BOB ($200/month premium)
────────────────────     ────────────────────────
Premium: $0              Premium: $2,400
Copays: $2,800           Copays: $600
Drugs: $2,400            Drugs: $800
Hospital: $3,000         Hospital: $500
────────────────────     ────────────────────────
TOTAL: $8,200/year       TOTAL: $4,300/year

BOB SAVES: $3,900/year
```

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Linda's $0 premium plan cost her $8,200 for the year. Bob's $200 monthly premium cost him $4,300 total. Bob paid higher premiums every month but saved almost $4,000 by the end of the year. Premium is just one number. Total cost is what matters."*

---

### **[49-54 seconds] - THE RULE**
**VISUAL:** Key message appearing  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "THE RULE:"
- "Premium = What you pay to have insurance"
- "Total Cost = What you ACTUALLY pay"
- "Choose based on TOTAL COST"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"The rule: Premium is what you pay to have insurance. Total cost is what you actually pay. Always choose based on total cost, not premium."*

---

### **[55-60 seconds] - CTA**
**VISUAL:** Calculator + YourMedGuy logo  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Calculate YOUR Total Cost"
- "Comment: GUIDE"
- "Book: YourMedGuy.com"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Calculate your total cost before choosing. Comment GUIDE or book at YourMedGuy.com. This is the final episode - you're now ready to choose smart."*

---

## **VERSION 2: 90-SECOND EXTENDED SCRIPT**

### **[0-8 seconds] - HOOK**
**VISUAL:** Two Medicare cards + calculator showing vastly different totals  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** "Plan A: $0 Premium → $8,200 Total. Plan B: $200/Month → $4,300 Total."  
**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Same person. Same health needs. Same doctors. Two different Medicare plans. One has a $0 premium but costs $8,200 per year. The other has a $200 monthly premium but only costs $4,300 total. How is that possible? And which one would you choose?"*

---

### **[9-28 seconds] - WHY LOW PREMIUM ≠ LOW COST**
**VISUAL:** Scale showing premium on one side, all other costs on other  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "PREMIUM is just ONE cost"
- "Other costs:"
- "• Deductibles"
- "• Copays"
- "• Coinsurance"
- "• Drug costs"
- "• Out-of-pocket maximum"
- ""
- "Low premium = Higher OTHER costs"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Here's why: Premium is just one piece of your total cost. There's also deductibles, copays, coinsurance, drug costs, and potential out-of-pocket maximums. Insurance companies aren't giving away free coverage. If the premium is low, they're making money through higher costs somewhere else. It's a trade-off. Low premium almost always means higher usage costs."*

---

### **[29-55 seconds] - THREE SCENARIOS**
**VISUAL:** Three different people with their cost breakdowns  

**SCENARIO 1: HEALTHY PERSON**
**TEXT OVERLAY:**
```
ALEX (Rarely sees doctors)
────────────────────────────
$0 Premium Plan:
• Premium: $0
• 2 doctor visits: $80
• No prescriptions: $0
Total: $80/year ✓ WINNER

$150/Month Plan:
• Premium: $1,800
• 2 doctor visits: $0
• No prescriptions: $0
Total: $1,800/year

BEST CHOICE: Low premium plan
```

**SCENARIO 2: CHRONIC CONDITIONS**
**TEXT OVERLAY:**
```
MARIA (Diabetes, high BP)
──────────────────────────
$0 Premium Plan:
• Premium: $0
• 12 doctor visits: $480
• Prescriptions: $2,400
• Quarterly labs: $600
Total: $3,480/year

$150/Month Plan:
• Premium: $1,800
• 12 doctor visits: $120
• Prescriptions: $600
• Quarterly labs: $0
Total: $2,520/year ✓ WINNER

BEST CHOICE: Higher premium plan
```

**SCENARIO 3: PLANNED SURGERY**
**TEXT OVERLAY:**
```
ROBERT (Knee replacement)
────────────────────────────
$0 Premium Plan:
• Premium: $0
• Surgery costs: $8,500
• Regular care: $1,200
Total: $9,700/year

• Premium: $2,400
• Surgery costs: $500
• Regular care: $400
Total: $3,300/year ✓ WINNER

BEST CHOICE: Higher premium plan
```

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Let's see three real scenarios. Alex is healthy, rarely sees doctors. For him, the $0 premium plan costs only $80 a year. The higher premium plan costs $1,800. Low premium wins. Maria has diabetes and high blood pressure. She sees doctors monthly and takes several medications. Her $0 premium plan costs $3,480. The higher premium plan with better coverage? $2,520. Higher premium wins. Robert needs knee replacement. His $0 premium plan costs him $9,700. The $200 monthly premium plan? Only $3,300. Higher premium wins big. See the pattern? It depends entirely on YOUR health needs."*

### **[56-75 seconds] - HOW TO CHOOSE**
**VISUAL:** Decision tree graphic  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "CHOOSE LOW PREMIUM if:"
- "✓ You're very healthy"

- "✓ No regular medications"
- "✓ No planned procedures"
- ""
- "CHOOSE HIGHER PREMIUM if:"
- "✓ Chronic conditions"
- "✓ Multiple medications"
- "✓ Frequent doctor visits"
- "✓ Planned surgery/procedures"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"So how do you choose? Pick a low premium plan if you're very healthy, rarely see doctors, take no medications, and have nothing planned. Pick a higher premium plan if you have chronic conditions, take multiple medications, see doctors frequently, or have procedures coming up. The sicker you are, the more a higher premium plan saves you money."*

### **Scale/Balance Animation:**
**Visual Concept:**
- Balance scale in center
- Left side: "Premium" (small weight)
- Right side: "All Other Costs" (large weight)
- Scale tips heavily to right

## **CAPTION/DESCRIPTION TEXT:**

### **60-Second Version Caption:**
```
💰 She Paid $0/Month. He Paid $200/Month. Who Saved Money?

LINDA chose Medicare Plan A:
• Monthly premium: $0
• Looks free, right?

BOB chose Medicare Plan B:
• Monthly premium: $200
• Expensive, right?

END OF YEAR TOTALS:

LINDA ($0 premium plan):
• Premiums: $0
• Doctor copays: $2,800
• Prescriptions: $2,400
• Hospital stay: $3,000
────────────────────
TOTAL: $8,200

BOB ($200/month premium):
• Premiums: $2,400
• Doctor copays: $600
• Prescriptions: $800
• Hospital stay: $500
────────────────────
TOTAL: $4,300

BOB SAVED: $3,900

HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

THE $0 PREMIUM TRAP:
Low/zero premium plans make money through:
• Higher copays ($40 vs $10 for doctor visits)
• Worse drug formularies (higher tiers)
• Bigger deductibles
• Higher coinsurance
• Limited networks

They're not giving away free insurance. They get you somewhere else.

THE RULE:
Premium = What you pay to have insurance
Total Cost = What you ACTUALLY pay

Always choose based on TOTAL cost, not premium alone.

WHO SHOULD CHOOSE LOW PREMIUM PLANS?
✓ Very healthy
✓ Rarely see doctors
✓ No prescriptions
✓ No planned procedures

WHO SHOULD CHOOSE HIGHER PREMIUM PLANS?
✓ Chronic conditions (diabetes, heart disease, etc.)
✓ Multiple daily medications
✓ Frequent specialist visits
✓ Planned surgery or procedures

The sicker you are, the more a higher premium plan saves you money.

### **90-Second Version Caption:**
```
💰 Plan A: $0 Premium → $8,200 Total Cost
💰 Plan B: $200/Month → $4,300 Total Cost

Which would YOU choose?

Most people pick Plan A ($0 premium). It's a trap.

Here's why TOTAL COST matters more than PREMIUM:

═══════════════════════════

WHY LOW PREMIUM ≠ LOW COST

Premium is just ONE piece of your total cost:
• Deductibles
• Copays
• Coinsurance  
• Drug costs
• Out-of-pocket maximum

Insurance companies aren't giving away free coverage.

Low premium = They make money through higher OTHER costs.

═══════════════════════════

3 REAL SCENARIOS:

SCENARIO 1: ALEX (Healthy, No Medications)
─────────────────────────────────────
$0 Premium Plan:
• Premium: $0
• 2 doctor visits: $80
→ Total: $80/year ✓ WINNER

$150/Month Premium:
• Premium: $1,800
• 2 doctor visits: $0
→ Total: $1,800/year

For healthy people, low premium wins.

SCENARIO 2: MARIA (Diabetes + High BP)
─────────────────────────────────────
$0 Premium Plan:
• Premium: $0
• 12 doctor visits: $480
• Prescriptions: $2,400
• Labs: $600
→ Total: $3,480/year

$150/Month Premium:
• Premium: $1,800
• 12 doctor visits: $120
• Prescriptions: $600
• Labs: $0
→ Total: $2,520/year ✓ WINNER
→ SAVES $960/year

For chronic conditions, higher premium wins.

SCENARIO 3: ROBERT (Knee Replacement)
─────────────────────────────────────
$0 Premium Plan:
• Premium: $0
• Surgery: $8,500
• Regular care: $1,200
→ Total: $9,700/year

$200/Month Premium:
• Premium: $2,400
• Surgery: $500
• Regular care: $400
→ Total: $3,300/year ✓ WINNER
→ SAVES $6,400/year

For planned procedures, higher premium wins BIG.

═══════════════════════════

HOW TO CHOOSE:

CHOOSE LOW PREMIUM IF:
✓ You're very healthy
✓ Rarely see doctors
✓ No regular medications
✓ No planned procedures
→ You won't use much healthcare

CHOOSE HIGHER PREMIUM IF:
✓ Chronic conditions
✓ Multiple medications
✓ Frequent doctor visits
✓ Planned surgery/procedures
→ You'll use healthcare often

THE PATTERN:
The more healthcare you use, the more a higher premium plan saves you money.

✓ Calculates YOUR total costs (not just premiums)

Check your DMs! Ready to enroll? Book at YourMedGuy.com"

### **Common Follow-Up Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "I'm healthy now but what if I get sick mid-year?"**
A: "You can't switch mid-year (except Special Enrollment). This is why you consider BOTH scenarios: What if I stay healthy? What if I get sick? Often the higher premium plan is 'insurance against needing insurance.' Great question!"

**Q: "Can I switch from low to high premium plan next year?"**
A: "YES! During Annual Enrollment Period (Oct 15-Dec 7) you can switch plans. Review every year as your health changes. That's why Episode 7's calculation matters annually!"

**Q: "What if I can't afford a high premium even though I need it?"**
A: "Let's check if you qualify for Extra Help (Medicare Savings Program). Many people do and don't know it. Or we can find a middle-ground plan. Your health matters - we'll find something that works. Book a consultation."

**Q: "My agent said $0 premium plans are best. Were they wrong?"**
A: "Not necessarily wrong - just incomplete. $0 premium plans ARE best for some people (healthy, no meds). But they're not best for everyone. Your agent should calculate YOUR total cost, not just show premiums. Want me to review?"

**Q: "Which episodes should I watch first if I'm just starting?"**
A: "Start with Episode 1, watch in order 1-8. Each builds on the previous. You'll understand Medicare completely in about an hour total. Playlist in bio!"

**Q: "Can you review my current plan?"**
A: "Absolutely! We offer free annual reviews. Book at YourMedGuy.com or DM me your plan name and I'll give you a quick assessment right here in comments."
