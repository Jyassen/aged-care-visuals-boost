### **[0-7 seconds] - HOOK**
**VISUAL:** Medical bills stacking up, person looking stressed, then relieved

---

### **[8-25 seconds] - WHAT IT IS**
**VISUAL:** Shield graphic protecting money + meter stopping at maximum  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM"
- "The MOST you'll pay in a year"
- "Then insurance covers 100%"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"It's called the out-of-pocket maximum. This is the MOST you'll pay in a single year. Once you hit this number, your insurance covers everything else at 100%. It's your financial safety net."*

---

### **[26-45 seconds] - WHO HAS IT, WHO DOESN'T**
**VISUAL:** Medicare Advantage card with checkmark + Original Medicare card with X  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Medicare Advantage: ✓ YES"
- "$8,000-$10,000 maximum"
- "Original Medicare: ✗ NO"
- "You pay 20% FOREVER"
- "No limit!"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Medicare Advantage plans have an out-of-pocket maximum - usually around $8,000 to $10,000 per year. But here's what shocks people: Original Medicare has NO out-of-pocket maximum. That 20% coinsurance? It never stops. There's no cap."*

---

### **[46-54 seconds] - REAL EXAMPLE**
**VISUAL:** Hospital + cancer treatment + dollar amounts side by side  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "$100,000 cancer treatment"
- "Advantage: You pay $8,500 max"
- "Original Medicare: You pay $20,000+"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Example: $100,000 cancer treatment. With Medicare Advantage, you hit your max at around $8,500, then pay nothing. With Original Medicare, you pay 20% - that's over $20,000 out of pocket."*

---

### **[55-60 seconds] - CTA**
**VISUAL:** YourMedGuy logo + phone number  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "Know YOUR out-of-pocket risk"

**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM"
- "The MOST you pay per year"
- "After that: Insurance pays 100%"
- "Your financial protection"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"It's the out-of-pocket maximum. This is the absolute most you'll pay in a calendar year for covered services. Once you hit this amount, your insurance takes over and pays 100% of everything else for the rest of the year. It protects you from catastrophic medical bills. It's your financial ceiling."*

---

### **[29-58 seconds] - WHO HAS IT, WHO DOESN'T**
**VISUAL:** Split screen - Advantage plan vs Original Medicare + visual meter comparison  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "MEDICARE ADVANTAGE"
- "✓ Has out-of-pocket maximum"
- "Typical: $8,000-$10,000/year"
- "2026 legal max: $12,000"
- ""
- "ORIGINAL MEDICARE"
- "✗ NO out-of-pocket maximum"
- "You pay 20% coinsurance"
- "Forever. No cap. No limit."
- "Could be $10K, $50K, $100K+"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Here's the critical difference: Medicare Advantage plans are required by law to have an out-of-pocket maximum. Most are between $8,000 and $10,000 per year. The legal maximum for 2026 is $12,000. But Original Medicare - what the government provides - has NO out-of-pocket maximum. None. You pay that 20% coinsurance on everything, forever, with no cap. A $50,000 hospital stay? You pay $10,000. A $200,000 cancer treatment? You pay $40,000. There's no limit on your financial risk."*

---

### **[59-76 seconds] - REAL EXAMPLES**

**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
**Scenario 1: $25,000 surgery**
- Advantage: $6,200 (then $0)
- Original: $5,000 (20% coinsurance)

**Scenario 2: $100,000 cancer treatment**
- Advantage: $8,500 max (then $0)
- Original: $20,000+ (20% coinsurance)

**Scenario 3: $250,000 complications**
- Advantage: $8,500 max (then $0)
- Original: $50,000+ (20% coinsurance)

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"Let's see real numbers. A $25,000 surgery: Medicare Advantage caps you at your out-of-pocket max, Original Medicare charges $5,000. Not bad. But a $100,000 cancer treatment? Advantage stops at $8,500. Original Medicare? Over $20,000. And if you have complications totaling $250,000? Advantage still stops at $8,500. Original Medicare could cost you $50,000 or more."*

---

### **[77-90 seconds] - SOLUTION & CTA**
**VISUAL:** Medigap card appearing + YourMedGuy logo  
**TEXT OVERLAY:** 
- "SOLUTION: Medicare + Medigap"
- "Fills the 20% gap"
- "Predictable costs"

**VOICEOVER:**  
*"If you want Original Medicare's doctor freedom but need protection, add a Medigap plan. It fills that 20% gap and gives you predictable costs. The question is: what's YOUR risk? Comment GUIDE for our protection calculator, or schedule a review at YourMedGuy.com. We'll show you your options."*

🛡️ The Medicare Number That Could Save You $50,000

OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM = The most you'll pay in a year

WHO HAS IT:
✅ Medicare Advantage Plans
→ Typical max: $8,000-$10,000/year
→ Legal max 2026: $12,000
→ After you hit it: Insurance pays 100%

WHO DOESN'T:
❌ Original Medicare
→ You pay 20% coinsurance
→ FOREVER
→ NO CAP, NO LIMIT

REAL EXAMPLE:
$100,000 cancer treatment
→ Medicare Advantage: You pay ~$8,500 (then $0)
→ Original Medicare: You pay $20,000+ (no limit)

This ONE number determines your financial risk.

Don't choose a Medicare plan without knowing your out-of-pocket maximum.

```
🛡️ Margaret Paid $7,800. Linda Paid $52,000. Same Surgery. Here's Why.

The difference? ONE Medicare number most people never check.

OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM: Your financial protection against catastrophic medical costs.

THE SHOCKING TRUTH:
Medicare Advantage Plans: Required to have an out-of-pocket maximum ($8K-$12K)
Original Medicare: NO out-of-pocket maximum (you pay 20% FOREVER)

REAL COST COMPARISONS:

💰 $25,000 Surgery
→ Advantage: $6,200 (capped)
→ Original: $5,000 (not bad)

💰 $100,000 Cancer Treatment  
→ Advantage: $8,500 max
→ Original: $20,000+ (no limit)

💰 $250,000 Complications
→ Advantage: $8,500 max
→ Original: $50,000+ (devastating)

The higher the medical costs, the more important your out-of-pocket maximum becomes.

ORIGINAL MEDICARE SOLUTION:
Add a Medigap (Supplement) plan
→ Fills the 20% gap
→ Protects you from unlimited costs
→ Predictable expenses

YOUR NEXT STEP:
Know YOUR out-of-pocket risk before enrolling.

Different plans have different maximums. Your health situation determines which protection level you need.

## **ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:**

### **Pinned Comment:**
"💬 QUIZ: Do you know YOUR plan's out-of-pocket maximum? Comment below and I'll tell you if that's good or if you're at risk. Free advice, no strings."

### **Auto-Reply for "GUIDE":**
"Just sent your Out-of-Pocket Protection Calculator! 📊 It'll show your maximum risk with different plans. Check your DMs and let me know if you have questions!"

### **Common Follow-Up Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "What's the out-of-pocket max for Medigap?"**
A: "Great question! Medigap works differently - it doesn't have an 'out-of-pocket maximum' because it fills the gaps in Original Medicare. Your costs are very predictable (just premiums + small deductible). I should make a video comparing this! Want me to?"

**Q: "Is the $8,000 maximum per person or per family?"**
A: "PER PERSON. If you and your spouse are both on Medicare, you each have your own out-of-pocket maximum. This is important for household budgeting!"

**Q: "Do premiums count toward the out-of-pocket maximum?"**
A: "NO! Your monthly premiums DON'T count. Neither do out-of-network costs. Only covered, in-network services count. This trips people up!"

**Q: "Can the out-of-pocket max change every year?"**
A: "YES! Plans can increase it annually (up to the legal maximum). This is why you should review your plan every Open Enrollment Period. Want a reminder?"

**Q: "I have Plan G Medigap. Do I have an out-of-pocket maximum?"**
A: "You have something better - you have almost NO out-of-pocket costs! Plan G covers almost everything after a small deductible. Your maximum risk is way lower than Medicare Advantage. Good choice if you can afford the premium!"

**Q: "Does the out-of-pocket max reset?"**
A: "YES! Every January 1st it resets to $0. This is important if you have ongoing treatment spanning two years - you'll hit maximums twice."
