📅 Book consultation: YourMedGuy.com/book

I can calculate your costs FOR you and explain everything 
step-by-step. No pressure, no obligation.

──────────────────────────────────────────────

❓ WHY KNOWING YOUR COSTS MATTERS:

Most people choose Medicare plans based on the premium alone.

"This one is $0/month - it must be the best!"

But the premium is just ONE cost. What about:
• Doctor visit copays?
• Prescription costs?
• Specialist visits?
• Hospital stays?

That $0 premium plan could cost you $6,000/year total.
While a $50/month plan might only cost $3,500/year total.

Don't guess. Know.

──────────────────────────────────────────────

📺 WATCH FIRST, CALCULATE LATER?

Prefer to learn before calculating?

Watch Episode 7: "How to Calculate YOUR Real Medicare Costs"

Then use the calculator with confidence.

P.S. Medicare enrollment has deadlines. Initial Enrollment 
Period is 7 months around your 65th birthday. Annual 
Enrollment is Oct 15-Dec 7. Don't miss your window!
