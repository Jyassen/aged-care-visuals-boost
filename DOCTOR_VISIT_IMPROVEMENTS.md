```typescript
// Annual costs
primaryCareCostAnnual = primaryCareVisits √ó primaryCareCopay
specialistCostAnnual = specialistVisits √ó specialistCopay
totalDoctorCostAnnual = primaryCareCostAnnual + specialistCostAnnual

// Monthly average (shown in breakdown)
avgDoctorCostMonthly = totalDoctorCostAnnual √∑ 12
```

### **Example: "Fair" Health Status**
```
Primary care: 4 visits √ó $15 = $60/year
Specialist: 6 visits √ó $45 = $270/year
Total: $330/year
Monthly average: $27.50/month
```
