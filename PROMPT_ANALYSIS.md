# **SYSTEM PROMPTS ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS**
## Review of SYSTEM_PROMPTS_ALL_DELIVERABLES.md for Cursor Implementation

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** ✅ Suitable with modifications required

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The system prompts in `SYSTEM_PROMPTS_ALL_DELIVERABLES.md` are **generally well-structured** but require **specific adjustments** for your actual codebase. I've created **CURSOR_PROMPTS_READY.md** with production-ready prompts that account for your:

- Existing tech stack and dependencies
- Current API structure
- Routing setup
- Project file organization

---

## **DETAILED ANALYSIS**

### ✅ **WHAT WORKS WELL**

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Prompts cover all necessary components
   - Step-by-step breakdown is logical
   - Good level of technical detail

2. **Tech Stack Alignment**
   - Correctly references React, TypeScript, Tailwind
   - Uses shadcn/ui components (already in your package.json)
   - Leverages lucide-react for icons (installed)

3. **Best Practices**
   - TypeScript interfaces defined first
   - Separation of concerns (utils, components, pages)
   - Mobile-responsive considerations

4. **Clear Structure**
   - Organized by deliverable type
   - Logical progression from types → logic → UI
   - Includes usage instructions

## **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**

### 🔴 **Issue #1: API Endpoint Mismatch**

**Problem:**
```typescript
// Prompts assume this works:
fetch('/api/contact', {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    ...formData,
    source: 'cost-calculator',
    context: { estimatedCosts: {...} }
  })
})
```

**Reality:** Your `api/contact.js` only expects:
```javascript
const { firstName, lastName, phone, email, bestTime, message } = req.body;
```

**Impact:** Tool submissions will fail or lose context data

**Solution:** Update API to accept `source` and `context` fields (provided in CURSOR_PROMPTS_READY.md)

---

### 🟡 **Issue #2: Enhanced vs. Basic Versions**

**Problem:** The prompts include TWO versions of the Cost Calculator:
- Basic version (lines 156-313)
- Enhanced version (lines 27-108) with health conditions, doctor visits

**Confusion:** Which one to build first?

**Recommendation:** 
1. Start with **basic version** (simpler, faster to implement)
2. Add enhancements in iteration 2 after testing
3. The enhanced version has more complexity that may slow initial launch

---

### 🟡 **Issue #3: Missing Enhanced Types**

**Problem:** Enhanced prompts reference `EnhancedCostCalculatorInput` interface but never define it fully

**Impact:** TypeScript errors when trying to build enhanced version

**Solution:** If building enhanced version, need to define:
```typescript
interface EnhancedCostCalculatorInput extends CostCalculatorInput {
  healthConditions: string[];
  doctorVisitFrequency: 'rarely' | 'occasionally' | 'frequently' | 'very-frequently';
  specialistVisitFrequency: 'rarely' | 'occasionally' | 'frequently' | 'very-frequently';
  currentInsurancePremium?: number;
  currentDoctorCopays?: number;
  currentPrescriptionCosts?: number;
}
```

---

### 🟡 **Issue #4: Analytics Assumptions**

**Problem:** Prompts include Google Analytics tracking:
```typescript
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && (window as any).gtag) {
  (window as any).gtag('event', 'cost_calculator_completed', {...});
}
```

**Reality:** No evidence Google Analytics is configured in your project

**Impact:** Code won't break, but analytics won't work

**Recommendation:** 
- Either: Set up GA4 first
- Or: Remove analytics code for MVP, add later

---

### 🟢 **Issue #5: Routing Pattern**

**Problem:** Prompts show routing example that doesn't match your current `App.tsx` structure

**Impact:** Minor - just need to adapt the example

**Solution:** CURSOR_PROMPTS_READY.md includes correct routing update for your actual `App.tsx`

---

### 🟢 **Issue #6: Medication Data Files**

**Problem:** Prompts reference `public/data/medications-common.json` that doesn't exist

**Impact:** Medication tool will fail without data

**Solution:** Need to:
1. Create medication data file
2. Or use a medication API
3. Or start with hardcoded common medications list

---

### 🟢 **Issue #7: LeadCaptureForm Dependencies**

**Problem:** Results component imports LeadCaptureForm before it's created

**Impact:** Build order matters - form must be created first

**Solution:** CURSOR_PROMPTS_READY.md has correct order (form before results)

---

## **RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1A: Foundation (Week 1)**

Use prompts from **CURSOR_PROMPTS_READY.md**:

1. ✅ Create folder structure
2. ✅ Build basic Cost Calculator (not enhanced)
3. ✅ Update API to handle tool submissions
4. ✅ Test end-to-end flow
5. ✅ Deploy to staging

**Time estimate:** 10-12 hours

---

### **Phase 1B: Enhancement (Week 2)**

After basic calculator is working:

1. Add health conditions checkboxes
2. Add doctor visit frequency
3. Enhance calculation logic
4. Add medication suggestions
5. Update results display

**Time estimate:** 6-8 hours

---

### **Phase 2: Medication Tool (Week 3-4)**

Reuse patterns from Cost Calculator:
1. Create medication types
2. Build medication search with autocomplete
3. Create comparison logic
4. Build results display
5. Add lead capture

**Time estimate:** 15-20 hours

---

## **PROMPT QUALITY ASSESSMENT**

### **Scoring Each Deliverable:**

| Deliverable | Original Prompts | Modified Prompts | Issues |
|------------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| Cost Calculator (Basic) | 8/10 | 10/10 | API mismatch, routing |
| Cost Calculator (Enhanced) | 6/10 | 9/10 | Missing types, complexity |
| Medication Tool | 7/10 | 9/10 | Missing data files |
| Plan Quiz | 7/10 | N/A | Out of Phase 1 scope |
| Lead Capture Form | 9/10 | 10/10 | Minor API adjustment |
| PDF Guides | 9/10 | N/A | Good as-is |

## **CURSOR-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **How to Use These Prompts with Cursor AI:**

1. **Use Cursor Chat (Cmd+L / Ctrl+L)**
   - Paste one prompt at a time
   - Review generated code before accepting
   - Test before moving to next prompt

2. **Work in Small Iterations**
   - Complete one component fully before starting next
   - Run `npm run dev` after each step
   - Check for TypeScript errors with `npm run lint`

3. **Leverage Cursor's Context**
   - Cursor can see your entire codebase
   - Reference existing components: "Use the same styling as Header component"
   - Ask for consistency: "Match the design patterns in CaptureForm.tsx"

4. **Use Composer for Multi-File Changes**
   - When creating related files (types + utils + component)
   - Cursor Composer can coordinate changes across files
   - Better than chat for complex multi-file operations

5. **Common Cursor Commands**
   ```
   "Fix all TypeScript errors in this file"
   "Make this mobile-responsive"
   "Add proper JSDoc comments"
   "Refactor to use existing components"
   "Match the styling in Header.tsx"
   ```

---

## **TESTING STRATEGY**

### **After Each Component:**

1. **TypeScript Validation**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

2. **Visual Testing**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Navigate to /tools/cost-calculator
   # Test on mobile viewport (Chrome DevTools)
   ```

3. **Functional Testing**
   - Test form validation (invalid inputs)
   - Test calculation logic (various scenarios)
   - Test lead submission (check email receipt)
   - Test mobile behavior (touch targets, scrolling)

4. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Chrome ✓
   - Safari ✓
   - Mobile Safari ✓
   - Mobile Chrome ✓

**QUESTIONS?**

Common concerns addressed:

**Q: Should I use the basic or enhanced Cost Calculator?**  
A: Start with basic. Add enhancements in iteration 2.

**Q: What if Cursor generates code that doesn't work?**  
A: Ask Cursor to "Fix all errors" or "Debug this component". It can see your error messages.

**Q: Can I modify the prompts?**  
A: Yes! Adapt them to your preferences. The structure is more important than exact wording.

**Q: Should I build all tools before launching?**  
A: No. Launch Cost Calculator first, gather data, iterate, then build next tool.

**Q: How do I know if it's working correctly?**  
A: Follow the testing checklist after each step. If forms submit and calculations work, you're good.
